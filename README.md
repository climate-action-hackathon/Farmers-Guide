# Farmers-Guide

Farmers guide is a platform that provides farmers with information about viability of current planting seasons for selected crops.

## Mission Statement:

Providing a platform that allows farmers to get information about farming activities, and distribute information that affect the farmers.

## What a Mission Statement is:

A concise summary of the aims and goals of a project.

## Problem Statement:

Due to the changing climatic conditions, there has been a shift in the planting seasons and patterns. This has rendered traditional methods of estimating start of season untenable. This has caused farmers, sometimes, to miss out on planting seasons.

We hope to empower farmers to be more productive by providing them with precise information on when to exercise their various farming activities maximizing on projected climate conditions.

Bridging the gap between fragmented datasets and local farmers.

## Use Case:

A farmer wants to know the viability of planting certain crop at a certain location at a certain time.
