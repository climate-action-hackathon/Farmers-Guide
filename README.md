## Mission Statement:

Providing a platform that allows farmer to get information about farming activities, and distribute information that affect the farmers.

## What a Mission Statement is:

A concise summary of the aims of a project.

## The Problem We are Trying to Solve:

Due to the changing climating conditions, there has been a shift in the planting seasons and patterns. This has rendered traditional methods of estimating start of season untenable.
This has cause farmers, sometimes, to miss out on planting season. By providing farmers with information about when to plant to maximize on projected rainfall amounts,
we hope to empower the farmers to be more productive.

Bridging the gap between fragmented datasets and local farmers

## Use Case:

A farmer wants to know the viability of planting certain crop at a certain location.
